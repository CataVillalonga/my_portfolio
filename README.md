Hello There !

Have a look at my postfolio : https://www.catavillalonga.com

This project was created with npm package manager , React, Javascript and CSS.

All the animations are done by me and this is only and MVP until I can release a better and cooler version !

I know it might sound weird to some people but this project was the final straw for me to realise that I actually enjoy doing my own CSS from scratch !

One of the next steps in this project is turning it into Typescript and adding more but subtle animations to other components.

If you are interested in learning animations I recommend you check my other project : https://github.com/CataVillalonga/the_btn_gallery

You can find really easy to follow animations for btns and images :)
